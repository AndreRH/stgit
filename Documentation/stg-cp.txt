NAME
----
stg-cp - stgdesc:cp[]

SYNOPSIS
--------
stg cp [OPTIONS] <file|dir> <newname>

stg cp [OPTIONS] <files|dirs...> <dir>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Make git-controlled copies of git-controlled files.  The copies are
added to the Git index, so you can add them to a patch with
stglink:refresh[].

In the first form, copy a single file or a single directory, with a
new name.  The parent directory of <newname> must already exist;
<newname> itself must not already exist, or the command will be
interpreted as one of the second form.

In the second form, copy one or several files and/or directories, into
an existing directory.

Directories are copied recursively.  Only the git-controlled files
under the named directories are copied and added to the index.  Any
file not known to Git will not be copied.

CAVEATS
-------

The first form doesn't allow yet to overwrite an existing file
(whether it could be recovered from Git or not), and the second form
does not check before overwriting any file, possibly leading to loss
of non-committed modifications.

FUTURE OPTIONS
--------------

--all::
	Also copy files not known to Git when copying a directory.

--force::
	Force overwriting of target files, even if overwritten files
	have non-committed changes or are not known to Git.

--dry-run::
	Show which files would be added, and which would be modified
	if --force would be added.
