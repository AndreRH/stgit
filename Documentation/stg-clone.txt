NAME
----
stg-clone - stgdesc:clone[]

SYNOPSIS
--------
stg clone [OPTIONS] <repository> <dir>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Clone a GIT <repository> into the local <dir> (using
gitlink:git-clone[1]) and initialise the resulting "master" branch as
a patch stack.

This operation is for example suitable to start working using the
"tracking branch" workflow (see gitlink:stg[1]).  Other means to setup
an StGIT stack are stgdesc:init[] and the '--create' and '--clone'
commands of stgdesc:branch[].

The target directory named by <dir> will be created by this command,
and must not exist beforehand.

OPTIONS
-------

No specific options.

StGIT
-----
Part of the StGIT suite - see gitlink:stg[1].
