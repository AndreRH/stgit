help = 'StGit-ify any git commits made on top of your StGit stack'

"assimilate" will repair three kinds of inconsistencies in your StGit
stack, all of them caused by using plain git commands on the branch:

  1. If you have made regular git commits on top of your stack of
     StGit patches, "assimilate" converts them to StGit patches,
     preserving their contents.

  2. Merge commits cannot become patches; if you have committed a
     merge on top of your stack, "assimilate" will simply mark all
     patches below the merge unapplied, since they are no longer
     reachable. If this is not what you want, use "git reset" to get
     rid of the merge and run "assimilate" again.

  3. The applied patches are supposed to be precisely those that are
     reachable from the branch head. If you have used e.g. "git reset"
     to move the head, some applied patches may no longer be
     reachable, and some unapplied patches may have become reachable.
     "assimilate" will correct the appliedness of such patches.

Note that these are "inconsistencies", not "errors"; furthermore,
"assimilate" will repair them reliably. As long as you are satisfied
with the way "assimilate" handles them, you have no reason to avoid
causing them in the first place if that is convenient for you."""
