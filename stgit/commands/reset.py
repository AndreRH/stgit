Reset the patch stack to an earlier state. The state is specified with
a commit from a stack log; for a branch foo, StGit stores the stack
log in foo.stgit^. So to undo the last N StGit commands (or rather,
the last N log entries; there is not an exact one-to-one
relationship), you would say

  stg reset foo.stgit^~N

or, if you are not sure how many steps to undo, you can view the log
with "git log" or gitk

  gitk foo.stgit^

and then reset to any sha1 you see in the log.

If one or more patch names are given, reset only those patches, and
leave the rest alone."""
