Takes one or more git commits at the base of the current stack, and
turns them into StGIT patches. These new patches are alreay applied,
at the bottom of the stack. This is the exact opposite of 'stg
commit'.

You can either give one patch name for each commit you wish to
uncommit, or use the --number option and exactly one patch name; StGIT
will then create numbered patches with the given patch name as prefix.

Only commits with exactly one parent can be uncommitted; in other
words, you can't uncommmit a merge."""
