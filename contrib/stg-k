# stg-k - execute given StGIT command while preserving local changes

# Uses a temporary patch to save local changes, then execute the given
# command, and restore local changes from the saved patch.  In
# essence, "stg-k pop" is a "stg pop -k" that works better, hence its
# name.

# CAVEAT: this script relies on the operation to run ignoring hidden
# patches, so in 0.12 (where "stg push" can push an hidden patch)
# "stg-k push" will fail midway, albeit with no information loss -
# you'll just have to finish manually.  Luckilly this appears to work
# on master branch.
