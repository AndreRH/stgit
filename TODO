The TODO list for the short term:

- tag (snapshot) command
- pull command (no longer rely on cogito or plain git)
- log command (it should also show the log per single patch)
- import command to import a series of patches or a single patch or a
  patch from a different branch in the same tree
- better help for commands
- bug reporting tool


Other things after the list above is completed:

- fold command (to merge 2 patches into one)
- automatic e-mail sending with the patches
- release 1.0


The future, when time allows or someone else does it:

- patches command to show the patches modifying a file
- patch dependency tracking
- multiple heads in a patch - useful for forking a patch,
  synchronising with other patches (diff format or in other
  repositories)
- remove the old base of the patch if there are no references to it
- write bash-completion script for the StGIT commands
