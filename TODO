The TODO list until 1.0:

- patch revisions support (including a log command)
- better handling of file renaming
- use same configuration file as GIT
- debian package support
- man page
- code execution allowed from templates
- more regression tests
- release 1.0


The future, when time allows or if someone else does it:

- patch dependency tracking
- multiple heads in a patch - useful for forking a patch,
  synchronising with other patches (diff format or in other
  repositories)
- write bash-completion script for the StGIT commands
