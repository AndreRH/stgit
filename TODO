The TODO list before 1.0:

- Convert the remaining commands to the new infrastructure. Commands
  not converted yet:
    branch
    import
    mail

- More regression tests

- Go through the design of the UI and make sure there's nothing hard
  to change in there that we'll regret later.

- Write a user guide. I'm thinking a document on the order of 10-30
  pages that'll explain why one would want to use StGit, and how.

- Make sure the rest of the documentation is in good shape.

- Release 1.0


The future, when time allows or if someone else does them:

- Patch dependency tracking
- Multiple heads in a patch - useful for forking a patch,
  synchronising with other patches (diff format or in other
  repositories)
- Numeric shortcuts for naming patches near top (eg. +1, -2)
