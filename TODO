The TODO list before 1.0:

- automatic patch signing (probably at import time)
- more regression tests
- stg help should probably pipe through the $PAGER
- configurable pull command (currently uses git-pull only)
- fix StGIT to run correctly in subdirectories
- use a separate index for some commands (refresh, fold etc.) so that
  files already added/removed are not automatically checked in
- interactive resolve command to invoke xxdiff, emacs etc.
- debian package support
- man page
- document the workflow on the StGIT wiki
- maybe a separate undo command rather than passing a --undo option to
  push and refresh
- use same configuration file as GIT
- release 1.0


The future, when time allows or if someone else does them:

- patch dependency tracking
- multiple heads in a patch - useful for forking a patch,
  synchronising with other patches (diff format or in other
  repositories)
- write bash-completion script for the StGIT commands
- "pull" argument should default to a sane value, "origin" is wrong in
  many cases
- commit directly to a patch which is not top
- patch synchronisation between between branches (as some people,
  including me have the same patches based on different branches and
  they have scripts for moving the changes in one to the others)
