The TODO list before 1.0:

- more regression tests
- use a separate index for some commands (refresh, fold etc.) so that
  files already added/removed are not automatically checked in
- document the workflow on the StGIT wiki
- release 1.0


The future, when time allows or if someone else does them:

- patch dependency tracking
- multiple heads in a patch - useful for forking a patch,
  synchronising with other patches (diff format or in other
  repositories)
- numeric shortcuts for naming patches near top (eg. +1, -2)
- (config?) parameter for number of patches included by "series -s"
