The TODO list until 1.0:

- prune command which preserves the unapplied patches as well
- tag (snapshot) command
- log command (it should also show the log per single patch)
- man page
- regression tests
- release 1.0


The future, when time allows or someone else does it:

- patch dependency tracking
- multiple heads in a patch - useful for forking a patch,
  synchronising with other patches (diff format or in other
  repositories)
- prune the old base of the patch if there are no references to it
- write bash-completion script for the StGIT commands
