The TODO list until 1.0:

- patch revisions support (including a log command)
- better handling of file renaming
- use same configuration file as GIT
- debian package support
- man page
- code execution allowed from templates
- more regression tests
- stg help should probably pipe through the $PAGER
- release 1.0


The future, when time allows or if someone else does it:

- patch dependency tracking
- multiple heads in a patch - useful for forking a patch,
  synchronising with other patches (diff format or in other
  repositories)
- write bash-completion script for the StGIT commands
- support for branches with / in names
  (ml: "Handle branch names with slashes")
- "pull" argument should default to a sane value, "origin" is wrong in
  many cases

Bugs:

- the following commands break in subdirs:
  - refresh (ml: "Running StGIT in subdirectories")
- "stg show" on empty patch shows previous patch
- "stg add" is accepted when no patch is applied, then any push says
  one must refresh first, which is obviously wrong
- "stg add" on files already added should print a notice, so that the
  user can catch a possible typo
