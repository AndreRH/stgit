Installing the Rust implementation of StGit:

    $ cargo install --locked path=.

The above will install the statically linked `stg` executable to
~/.cargo/bin, by default. The --root option, CARGO_INSTALL_ROOT
environment variable, or install.root Cargo config value may be
used to change where StGit is installed.


Basic installation of the Python implementation of StGit:

	$ make all doc
	$ make install install-doc

By default, StGit is installed to the $(HOME)/.local/{bin,lib,share}
directories, as specified by the systemd file-hierarchy and XDG Base
Directory specs. To install elsewhere, the prefix variable can be set:

	# make prefix=/usr/local install install-doc

It is also possible to install StGit within a Python virtual environment:

    (my-venv) $ python setup.py install

Issues of note:

- To build and install the documentation, you need to have the
  asciidoc/xmlto toolchain.  The default build target ("make all")
  does _not_ build them.
