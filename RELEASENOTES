Stacked Git 0.15
----------------

StGit 0.15 is available, and can be checked out from
git://repo.or.cz/stgit.git or http://download.gna.org/stgit/.

StGit is a Python application providing functionality similar to Quilt
(i.e. pushing/popping patches to/from a stack) on top of Git. These
operations are performed using Git commands, and the patches are
stored as Git commit objects, allowing easy merging of the StGit
patches into other repositories using standard Git functionality.

Bugs can be reported on the Git mailing list or via the project bug
tracker at https://gna.org/bugs/?group=stgit.

The main changes since release 0.14.3 are

- New core infrastructure for repository operations
- Infinite undo/redo operations and corresponding commands
- Automatic reverting of changes following a failed operation (using
  transactions)
- New 'squash' command for combining two or more patches into one
- New 'publish' command for maintaining merge-friendly branches (which
  are not rebased)
- New patch identification format - <branch>:<patch> (see 'id'
  command)
- UI improvements and removal of the 'add', 'rm' and 'resolved'
  commands since there are corresponding Git equivalents
- Emacs mode improvements
- Man pages and improved tutorial

Special thanks go to Karl Hasselstr√∂m for the hard work done on the
new StGit features.
