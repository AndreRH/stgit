                      Stacked Git 0.20 released
                      -------------------------

StGit is a Python application providing functionality similar to Quilt
(i.e. pushing/popping patches to/from a stack) on top of Git. These
operations are performed using Git commands, and the patches are
stored as Git commit objects, allowing easy merging of the StGit
patches into other repositories using standard Git functionality.

Changes since 0.19:
===================

Features:
- `stg patches -d` can now output colored diffs.
- `stg publish --overwrite` allows branch to be overwritten instead of creating
  new commits.
- `stg log --clear` deletes the stack's log history. Use with caution.
- Fish shell completions for stg.
- Zsh completions for stg.
- Branch protection metadata now captured in config instead of
  .git/patches/<branch>protect file. This updates stgit's metadata format from
  v2 to v3.
- `stg mail --domain` option overrides the host's domain in the message ID.

Bug fixes:
- `stg show` detects conflicting --applied and --unapplied options.
- `stg show --stat` now shows commit headers.
- `stg patches --diff` now shows proper diff instead of `b'...'` repr of diff.
- `stg diff --range` detects some invalid values (e.g. `-r ..`).
- `stg diff` no longer shows binary diffs by default. Use `-O--binary` or add
  `--binary` to stgit.diff-opts in config.
- Date parsing is now more portable, only use platform specific `date` as last
  parsing option. Affects, e.g., `stg refresh --authdate`.
- Repaired seach path for templates to avoid looking in Python site-packages
  directory.
- Ensure stdout and stderr are flushed. Rarely affected `stg diff`.
- `stg repair` will now fail if extra command line arguments are provided.
- Bash completions are now generated in a reproducible manner.
- `stg edit --diff` on an empty patch no longer crashes.
- Diagnostic output is now routed to stderr instead of stdout. Diagnostic output
  is also now sent to stderr unconditionally, i.e. no more isatty() test (#35).
- `stg pick` no longer fails when picked commit has empty message (#39).
- `stg rebase` no longer crashes when there are conflicts (#34).
- `stg pick` no longer crashes if --name is not provided when picking a regular
  commit object.

Code quality:
- Converted to "new" lib infrastructure: show, patches, diff, pick, pull,
  rebase, and fold.
- Improved test coverage for: branch, diff, pick, sync,
- New tests for: files, patches, fold, series
- Portable use of iconv, sort, and sed in tests.
- Linting using flake8 and isort.
- All Python code now conforms to PEP-8.
- Updated test infrastructure from git 2.20.
- Parallel tests with coverage (`make -j4 coverage`) now works.
- Documentation build is not included in code coverage.
- Repaired log end messages when using STGIT_SUBPROCESS_LOG=debug.
- Renamed "dunder" instance attributes to improve debugging.
- Fail faster when patch name has slash ('/') (#24).
